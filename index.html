  <p>We are SIS – the UK’s Secret Intelligence Service - also known as MI6. Our people work secretly around the world to make the UK safer and more prosperous. For over 100 years SIS has ensured the UK and our allies keep one step ahead of our adversaries. We are creative and determined - using cutting-edge technology and espionage.</p>
  <p>We work closely with MI5, GCHQ, HM Armed Forces, law enforcement and a range of other international partners. Everything we do is tasked and authorised by senior government ministers and overseen by Parliament and independent judges. People who work for MI6 come from all walks of life, with different skills, interests and backgrounds.</p>
